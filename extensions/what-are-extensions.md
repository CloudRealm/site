# What are extensions?

On iOS, Apple supports [iMessage Apps](https://developer.apple.com/imessage/), allowing developers to integrate custom experiences into your conversations.

OpenBubbles exposes equivalent APIs allowing iOS iMessage apps to be ported to Android.

[A bare-bones sample extension](https://github.com/OpenBubbles/OpenBubblesSampleExtension) is provided for your reference.

## How do they work?
Extensions are installed as separate applications on Google Play and communicate with OpenBubbles over Binder IPC with AIDL. You control and publish your extension independently. 

Your extension must be vetted and registered with OpenBubbles to show up in production. When users receive a message by your extension, they will be prompted to install your app. OpenBubbles will take a cut of any revenue generated by your extension.

A *developer mode* is provided in OpenBubbles to allow developers to build and test extensions before publishing.

## Do I have to be the original developer to make a compatible app?
No. However, you must follow all applicable trademark and copyright laws, and may not use any copyrighted material without a license.

## Supported APIs
* Send custom messages (including images)
* Dynamic/Live messages
* Sessions (updating messages)
