# Troubleshooting

## My contacts aren't showing
When you first install OpenBubbles, your contacts may not be properly displayed. In order to fix this, restart your phone.

## I can't send or receive messages

* Running clear identity cache (Go to Settings -> Developer Tools) - This may help with sending messages.
* Make sure iMessage and Facetime is disabled and you are logged out of iCloud if you are using an iPhone.
* You are deregistered - Check your registration status and renewal time in your profile settings and check your registration method and try again.
* Advanced Data Protection is enabled - Disable this option
* Contact Key Verification is enabled - Disable this option
* Your Apple Account/Hardware has been throttled/banned/blocked by Apple - Visit this [site](https://rentry.org/applebans) to learn more. You may need to create a new account.

## I keep getting sent back to the login screen
* Make sure you are logged out of iCloud on the relay device (if applicable)
* Delete duplicate device logins on account.apple.com

## Debug relay issues (device offline/code not found)
* Make sure your device is powered on.
* Make sure your device is connected to Wi-fi
* Change Auto-Lock to never on your device (This may lead to screen burn in, lowering brightness will help mitigate this)
* Enable Keep Awake in relay app
* If using a VPN check if Apple domains and services are bypassed.
* Make sure relay app and OpenBubbles are updated

## I can't see sent messages on other Apple devices, even though my Apple Account is linked
* This is a known issue and fixes itself after 24 hours.
